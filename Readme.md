## Instructions

The code here requires a Google Cloud Platform API key and a Google Maps custom Map ID in order to work.

The places that need updating are:

* Add the API_KEY and MAP_ID in the `<script>` tag for the Maps API in the `index.html` file
* Add in the MAP_ID in the `script.js` file

# Requirements
* Display a Google Map on your website with a custom color theme
* Center the map at a particular latitude/longitude
* Use custom markers around the map

# Implementation
* Create a Google Cloud Platform project
* Style your map in Google Map Management
* Use the map ID and API key to load the map on your website with the Google Maps JavaScript API
* Use CSS to display and style the map on the website
* Use the JavaScript API to customize the map settings like center point and zoom
* Create and place custom map markers
